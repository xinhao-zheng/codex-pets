Create one horizontal animation strip for Codex pet `cyber-otter-2077-pixel-edition`, state `running-left`.

Use the attached canonical base for identity. Use the attached layout guide only for slot count, spacing, centering, and padding; do not draw the guide.

Output exactly 8 full-body frames in one left-to-right row on flat pure user-selected #00FF00. Treat the row as 8 invisible equal-width slots: one centered complete pose per slot, evenly spaced, with no overlap, clipping, empty slots, labels, or borders.

Identity: same pet in every frame: Plump cyberpunk sea otter inspired by the provided reference: broad rounded head, small round ears, huge dark nose, large black eyes with tiny block highlights, cream muzzle and belly, medium-dark brown body, magenta circuitry on viewer-left face and cyan circuitry on viewer-right face, dark tactical chest harness with small cyan-magenta light blocks, simplified short fishing rod and reel attached to the paws, thick tapered tail. Preserve the same side-specific markings, face, proportions, harness, rod and tail across every frame. No readable text, logo, HUD, city, detached effects or scenery.. Preserve silhouette, face, proportions, markings, palette, material, style, and props.
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `pixel`: Pixel-art-adjacent digital mascot with a chunky silhouette, simple dark outline, limited palette, flat cel shading, and visible stepped edges. User style notes: Match the installed official Codex v2 pets: author directly at 192x208 cell scale, thick dark stepped outline, crisp pixel clusters, chunky chibi silhouette, limited color ramps, block-shaped highlights, selective texture only, no smooth painterly gradients, no fake low-resolution enlargement, no anti-aliased sticker edge..
Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Dragging-left loop: show directional movement to the left through body and limb poses only.

State requirements:
- Show directional drag movement to the left through body, limb, and prop movement only.
- The row must unmistakably face and travel left.
- The movement cadence must alternate visibly across the 8 frames instead of repeating one nearly static stride.
- Do not draw speed lines, dust clouds, floor shadows, motion trails, or detached motion effects.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.
